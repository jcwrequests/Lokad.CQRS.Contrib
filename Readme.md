This is a contrib project to Lokad CQRS at https://github.com/Lokad/lokad-cqrs.  This project is a place to share new ideas and implementations usig Lokad.CQRS and is not the creation of Lokad and Rinat Abdullin but is an attempt to give back to all of their hard work.  Currently the project is exploring the use of Lucene.NET to enchance some of the fuctionality of Lokad.Portable.  

The inspiration for this endevour was to find a way to make projections more powerful without compromising simplicity.  I wrote a post about this at http://wysnet.blogspot.com/2012/11/projections-and-lucenenet.html.  My future plans are to also create a back up facility to make hot backups of the Lucene index possible.

If anyone wants to share their ideas, templates are whatever code that they find useful but would not necessarily be something that would be added to Rinat's project just contact me and I will be happy to add your contributions.
